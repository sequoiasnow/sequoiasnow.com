# What is DNA?

It means one thing in biology, it means another in web design. Simply put DNA
is responsible for managing all the data and larger state that accompanies it
in the application. In coordination with RNA, DNA connects complex state and 
ideas of data to the application. 

## Wait, what? RNA?

RNA is responsible for connecting components to the store, basically a 
glorrified wrapper for the REDUX connect function.
