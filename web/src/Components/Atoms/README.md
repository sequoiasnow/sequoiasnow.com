# Atoms

Atoms are the building block of the entire site, they are simplistic component's that nonetheless are essential to the entire application. Atoms have three basic tenants.

* They must **not** preserve state.
* They must **not** rely on other components.
* They must **not** effect their children.

Aside from this atoms are simple creatures, but hugely beneficial. They can be tedious to create but they make code much more accessible and usable.
