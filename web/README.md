# Styleguide

Not only is this section the basis for the client side application of the 
blog but it is also the basis of the styleguide located at /styleguide. It
works by extracting javascript code in the markdown of a component folder
and turning it into a page. It follows the atomic design principle, including
colors which are extracted from the `_variables.scss` file. The documentation
there follows the sassdoc principles though that might not be necessary.
